eire23,"Surprised there wasn't a thread on this with some of the details being out out yesterday. What are people thoughts on it. Sheep welfare scheme has been renewed which is good as its money for something that one would be doing anyways. Something for the suckler in it as well? See a new environmental scheme with a max payment of 10k what ever tthat will involve. Front loading on the first 30ha but it seems a small figure, something around 45 an entitlement. Thought it would've been more to suit some smaller farms. Was chatting the ag consultant this morning and she said that any land that's reseeded or getting a lot of manure will be impossible to get into these schemes or get a very low score. Click to expand... I'm looking at it from a critical point of view. Only 15% of farms will qualify for tier 2 of Glas and €10,000 so 85% of farms will only get a max of €7000 in Glas and with inflation, we won't be any better off than we were with Glas. Suckler farmers can already access grants of close to €200 per cow between BDGP and BEEPs. They are making it out that they are giving €300 more per cow. They're not. There's a lot of hoops to get the €200 that we already get and it looks like many, many more hoops to get the €300 proposed. Lads that weren't in BDGP or that didn't keep up their numbers, will face serious spend for to get there. Also, many lads don't think BDGP was a good idea ( I thought it was great!), so they will be hard to persuade to go into it. From talking to a planner doing plans for REAP, the multi species crop won't be a measure suited to any grassland that is being managed - any land that got sprayed with mcpa in the last 5 years won't make it. Any land reseeded in recent years won't make it. Any land getting a lot of fertilizer or slurry won't make it. I might farm wet land, but I try to grow as much grass as I can. I don't see it fair that they will reward my neighbor who puts nothing into grass management. But I'm sure that some of the lads who have recently sown multi species crops will gain from it. It's better than nothing, but if they expect it to make up for any future reduction in cow numbers, it won't. It might force more lads to get out altogether and plant their land or rent it to the dairy farmers."

Seedsower,"It's hard to not be concerned for the future if you have a decent payment per acre built up.convergence is coming though it's hard to figure out. Looks like a high payment will be halved from its original value or worse and will possibly have to do eco measures to get that much.with the carbon budget reductions it's like the future has a dark cloud over it Click to expand... The minister was visiting locally last week and got a hot reception i believe. One point a lot of ifa reps were making which I'd disagree with was that any increases and some of the decreases were being disguised in schemes with more work and paper etc. Rather than coming in the SFP. Broadly speaking I dont mind how many schemes there are, if it pays to fill out forms and carry out some environmental actions better than it does to finish stock im.ok with that to a certain level. A lot of lads still run down BEEP and BDGP and I know some who refuse to weigh stock and just make up the figures etc. To me thats nuts, those schemes are decent money for small input, more of those would be fine. That said there are other elements of the carbon reduction model that are needing a lot more work and would be happy to see more lobbying there"
candor,"With regard to convergence, to be honest it makes sense that it's a flat payment. Obviously that still depends on what land base you have to work with but at least the playing field is starting to level somewhat. Historical activities shouldn't come into it, as that is not neccessarily what is happening on the ground now. @muckymanor does make a good point about inflation though. The reduction in payments doesn't track with that. I'm new to farming in my own right and am treating the payment as a little business start up grant and am looking for ways to diversify farm income to keep my family on the land going into the future. Click to expand... Just on inflation, taking an average of 2% a year over the last 20 years, and not compounding it, along with the 2 cuts already taken out before convergence kicked in, the value of our BPS is now less than half of what we received 20 years ago."
Spade,"Just on inflation, taking an average of 2% a year over the last 20 years, and not compounding it, along with the 2 cuts already taken out before convergence kicked in, the value of our BPS is now less than half of what we received 20 years ago. Click to expand... This is a quick and simple way to see how inflation works over the years: Interactive Data Visualisations | CSO Ireland www.cso.ie Taking £5000 punts in November 1995, converted to euro (£1=€1.27), leaves the actual value now at over €10,000. I'm still for convergence but the rising tide of inflation should be part of the equation too."

In many ways, it's convergence by the back door. All pay into it, high and low entitlements, and all qualifying will withdraw equally from it. The money from those not drawing it down is supposed to be divided equally among the qualifying farmers but whether that's in the qualifying year or the one after or it will be siphoned off into a new scheme is unclear as yet."
Nashty,"I think the planting the few trees option and GPS fertiliser spreading will be the popular options, those look like the ones I would go for myself anyways, even an intensive dairy farmers would benefit from the GPS fertiliser spreading and I think a certain proportion of trees to replace those that fall over time is not a bad thing in ditches from a shelter perspective if nothing else.

Seedsower,"I wonder what's the specification for non productive land?just close the gate? Can you ever graze it? Can it be in small bits of corners etc? It would have to have been claimed on your area aid I presume. Apparently bog may not count Click to expand... I don't have answers to all that. All that I have read is that land that was previously removed from area aid applications because of scrub can now be claimed on. I'd imagine that whatever land you want to claim on will have to have been identified on your maps up to now, you may not have been claiming for it because it was covered in scrub or you may not have already been leaving it aside as non productive land for wildlife or Carbon storage. But it will have to have been already on your maps. I can't see how they can penalise you if you are already doing what they want you to do. I have also read that all hedgerows will be measured and counted as non productive land."

Seedsower,Ms awards are expensive to establish and have poor persistence Click to expand... No more expensive than other reseeds in terms of the work done to establish. The seed cost for the same seeding rate came in at roughly €10 per acre more expensive compared with a general grass mixture. The seed cost €97 per acre at 15kg. We are farming organically so no spray or fertiliser costs and it's growing away well. I'll come back to you in 10 years on the persistence. We'll be doing holistic planned grazing (similar to mob grazing in some respects) and I think the various species stand a better chance at persisting using that type of grazing management.
exe,"Can you expand on the soil sampling bit, or point me in the right direction for books or papers ect? Click to expand... My biggest cost was I corrected my soil just using the Ph as a sole measurement by applying calcium lime. When in fact I should have been using dolomitic lime, but the Morgans test reads Magnesium incorrectly, so even though I was Index 4 for Mg on standard soil test, my Mg was on the floor. Corrected my problem buying a much more expensive Magnesium that probably cost me 25k extra over the last decade."

MSS has worked well in Ireland with the last few years. The test of MSS here will be the persistency and sward recovery after a wet year where cattle still have to get out in less than ideal conditions to graze. I'll be avoiding it until I see it on heavy ground in a normal year or normal ground in a wet year. I have doubts that the chicory and plantain will survive those conditions and, so far anyway, over seeding has proved marginally beneficial wherever I've come across it.

Click to expand... From what I have read, one of the key things to MSS is a 30 day rotation. That won't suit the more intensive farmers in this country. For me, the big advantage should be lower fertilizer requirement. I can do the 30 day rotations. I wouldn't mind oversowing or stitching in seed every 4 or 5 years if the fertilizer savings being quoted are accurate. I know that it comes down to having proper pH and p and k indexes, but I'm confident that I have those in line for next year."

This led over time to a greater variety of grass and herb species spreading threw the sward.The advantages of this was obviously low cost and allowed time for stock to get used to different sward mixes. I suspect it helped too that we have s0me SAC land which held a seed bank of these species so that obviously doesn't apply to everyone. However we did do some scarifying and over seeding with clover and timothy to speed things up on the outfarm which is generally drier ground and that worked well. We found the older native grass strains were also more robust when it came to late spring droughts or water logging after wet winters in terms of leafy re-growth when grazed"

Spreading soiled water is going to be more restricted and a separate holding tank might be needed. Fertiliser allowances dropped by 10% next year and another 5% in 2024. A 2 week reduction in permitted artificial fert spreading much the same as the slurry one above. There's a requirement to shallow cultivate tillage ground post harvest or sow a crop within 14 days.

ithastopay,"For the reasons mentioned above, We didn’t participate, in the recent soil sampling scheme. I have a similar view of new greening measures, there wasn’t much of a battle to get the extra options included, when it looked like farmers, were not going to participate in the scheme. The greening payment is going to be in the region of €25-€30/ac, not a lot of money in the bigger scheme of things. I fear that signing up to it, could leave farmers in the same position, as forestry owners are in now. Click to expand... I received approval for participation in the scheme before Christmas but I'll be delaying taking samples as long as possible until there's a lot more information coming out about the long term ownership of our soil carbon."

The EU are making all the noises on the Green budget and what they are going to do to reduce emissions. It seems to me that whatever happens it will be introduced at European level and not at local level unless some specific exemption (such as the nitrates derogation). In that cases, our shower can do very little about it despite the current fiasco on forestry. On the greening payment, one could argue as tillage farmers obeying the 3 crop rule that we are already complicit in that? It has been opened up now that it will be harder not to qualify but the devil will be in the detail, the main one being eligible ground so for MSS is it grazing ground, for tillage measure is it tillage ground but what about stocking rate is it whole farm or grazing ground only."

Cjmc,"Got a letter from the department today about CAP 2023, presume everyone else did as well. Am I right in saying that, for a farmer in the ANC scheme, he/she will have to keep more stock than they are currently keeping in order to satisfy the minimum stocking requirements under the new ANC scheme, as it looks like most cattle will count as less of a livestock unit than they currently do? Click to expand... I got it yesterday, I never noticed the livestock units had been changed, you're correct, you will have to keep more stock to qualify. What's this about the eco scheme and 2022 being used as a reference year, will the number of livestock units determine how much you get paid or will everyone get the same if they are between 0.15 and 1.5"

Ours is low according to the online figure (barely 5% I’d say). According to our Teagasc advisor, these figures will need to be checked by everyone as the online measurements are likely to be inaccurate (based on past experiences with automated measurement of hedges etc). We received permission to remove our last remaining non-boundary hedge earlier this year. It’ll be replaced on a boundary where only a wire fence exists between ourselves and a neighbour. Might aswell go for its removal now as such activities will likely become more difficult in the future."

It is 18% but there are some amendments from this year to be made. Even with those made, I'm still on 15% or so. I'm not complaining, the small fields here finally are proving useful!! If any changes have to be made for what Cork says I'd hope they will keep me in the 10 to 12% mark. Achieving the other requirements for the old greening payment would not be simple here. I dont see how the limiting fertiliser usage works on a mixed farm if I'm being honest."

Nope it can fluctuate up and down as you split parcels and actions. Say with grass margins on a separate lips number.
Patrol,"I was checking the Space for Nature figure for my farm. It’s very low at 2.31% and I’ve a lot of mature hedges, trees and drains. I looked at a few parcel maps and the bits that were deemed to be ineligible ie hedges , drains and scrub etc and taken off the claimed area for the spf over the last few years. They don’t seem to be included now as areas for SFN. It seems very complicated to take SFN areas off individual parcels. Would it be easier & more accurate to take a whole farm / block of land and take the spf claimed area and buildings/ roadways away and be left with the SFN area ? Click to expand... They are treated with caution. I do not see any reason why your cases above should not be included. You may have some editing to do when you see your advisor."
