Franz_Werfel,"the famers protests on the continent were about fuel prices and subsidies, now they've tacked on some nebulous complaints about EU regulation, without saying specifically which ones.

i will also say that it requires a massive amount of cognitive dissonance for irish famers to protest against EU ag-policy.."
lamahorses,Over 30% of the European budget is on CAP etc
ConnolysMoustache,"What are they even protesting?

The IFA representative on prime time couldn’t even say when asked what specifically they were upset with, just that they want recognition(?). He clearly didn’t know why they were even protesting beyond a general hate of regulations and wanting “recognition” as he put it. 

Did the lads just want to do an unplanned tractor run.

You can’t get free money from the EU without any regulations. The arrogance of some farmers is unreal. If you don’t like the regulations, don’t take the money, if you like the money, uphold your side of the deal and implement the regulations.

I wish that farmers weren’t such a powerful voting block in this country, would love to see politicians call this shit out."
bintags,These people are brainwashed. 
gofuckyoureself21,"Stop bitching at each other and get out and support the farmers, literally the backbone of the country."
No-Category-38,People with jobs are too busy for this shit.
af_lt274,">massive amount of cognitive dissonance for irish famers to protest against EU ag-policy..

Decades of production caps would say otherwise. Farmers want to produce food, not be recipients of single farm payments."
DiscussionUnusual466,"Well now , just to break in down quickly for you , EU wants to lower our carbon footprint so it's targeting farming by reducing subsidies ,  things like fuel, grain and feed for cows etc. This drives up cost for the farmers and thus pushes up their prices , this makes them uncompetitive in the global market as most farms and coops goods gets sold as future contracts and they end up losing out . The farms become unsustainable and have to eventually be sold , big corporations and billionaires like bill gates buy them as land banks for a reduced rate. Eventually our food production will be like manufacturing and offshored to cheaper countries with lower standards in environment but the EU can claim they lowered our emotions even though our populations and consumption go up to support the Ponzi scheme and their pensions.

The Irish countryside must be full of crops."
bintags,The cognitive dissonance is all that’s keeping them going. They’re like religious people. 
Healthy-Travel3105,I thought their issue was having to compete with imported products that don't have to follow the same regulations?
JRR_STARK,"Alright, you know more about agriculture then the farmers"
Franz_Werfel,What are they protesting about?
Conscious_Accident85,"What came before them regulations though was a lot lot worse. There were lands being massively overgrazed and destroyed because with how the subsidies were set up based on herd size more so than land you could have 1000 sheep on a field that could only feed 100. 

In the long term them policies were disastrous."
Conscious_Accident85,"Irelands manufacturing sector is the largest in the world relative to population and is growing fast. It’s on pace the overtake the UKs in total size within 5 years. We benefited from US companies outsourcing and setting up plants here not the other way around. We’ve benefited from the EU on this front as well.

Very few if any farms in Ireland are owned by big corporations or bill gates. The main issue in Irish farming is the cartel running the factories and slaughterhouses. We are one of biggest recipients of EU grants. Farming in Ireland has massively benefited from the eu."
Deleted,"If the farmers can't keep their business's going without subsidies, then they deserve to be put out of business.

This didn't come out of nowhere, they've had about 20 years of warning to prepare and diversify their farms, as plenty have, and those who refuse to adapt are sadly going to go bankrupt and lose their farms. 

>The farms become unsustainable and have to eventually be sold , big corporations and billionaires like bill gates buy them as land banks for a reduced rate. 

These stubborn farmers will be able to choose who to sell their land to, they'd have loads of other options, but yes, you're correct, they probably will sell them to the highest bidder, no matter what plans the buyer has, because it never really was about ""love of the land"" for those farmers anyway."
DiscussionUnusual466,"They receive the subsidiary to keep the price that you pay low ...so another way of thinking is why do you pay so little for your food , look at other under developed nations where food will cost you most of your salary because it's not subsidised "
RoyRobotoRobot,There is a good bit of mismanagement of funds at Government level. DAFM has a lot to answer for. But that could be said about the whole Government.
DiscussionUnusual466,"The only cognitive dissonance  going on here is that you don't understand that you are the end beneficiary of the subsidies by not paying market rate for your food ...all the raw materials for everything you eat and drink is dependent on subsidies , take them away and watch those prices climb , farmers will always have a full plate and be able to feed themselves , you however ...I doubt you could keep a house plant alive for longer then a month "
ConnolysMoustache,"If it is the IFA guy on prime time neglected to say that. They need a new media guy.


Also if that’s their issue, those imports don’t get flushed with EU money. 30% of the EU budget goes towards CAP.

It’s really very simply. The EU isn’t a magic money tree. If you want / get their money you have to comply with regulations.

Those imports don’t get EU money so don’t have the same regulations. I presume it’s Argentine beef we’re talking about."
DiscussionUnusual466,Your food prices going up 
DiscussionUnusual466,"To date that is true that farms have benefited , but that is changing , most farmers or mortgaged up to the eyes because believe it or not harvesters and other equipment cost a eye watering amount , most people think farmers have a tone of money because of land vale but in truth its all owned in debt and most are just keeping their heads above water because of the subsidies "
RoyRobotoRobot,You do know we subsidize farmers to keep food prices down? You seem to have a very poor understanding of how the agricultural industry works and if you ever dealt with the grant schemes you would realize that DAFM is ran about aswell as RTÉ.
BB2014Mods,"> If the farmers can't keep their business's going without subsidies, then they deserve to be put out of business.

You are a total fucking moron, like this has got to be the absolute shittiest take I have ever seen on Reddit"
DiscussionUnusual466,"ok smooth brain, look at what happened when the war in the Ukraine started, and grain prices went up ? Feed for cattle when up , so price of milk , cheese beef went up all , same for flour and the beer , all the ingredients need for a burger and beer, and you have seen the cost of living go up with that ... the reason for the subsidies is to lower the cost of food for us, the consumers. 

If you want 10 quid pints of milk without subsidies, then the same logic should be applied to everything including social housing, which believe it or not is used to lower the cost of labor,  it lowers the need to pay a fair wage because housing is artificially blow what the market would pay. In the same way if you were to pay the fair price for any ingredient off a farm you would be paying much higher prices as farmers would not take the risk of overproducing which is why we subsidies in the first place....."
lkdubdub,But Bill Gates!
TruthSeeker101110,"You sure? i thought Ireland was [a net exporter](https://www.enterprise-ireland.com/en/supports/become-more-innovative/technology-centres/mti#:~:text=Ireland%20is%20the%20biggest%20net,of%20MTI's%20Phase%20II%20programme). Maybe it keeps the EU's food lower. Not sure about domestically."
bintags,"I disagree, farmers are thick "
showars,"Begs the question of why we would consciously sell food that doesn’t adhere to EU regulations? Are the regulations not necessary for the quality of the food in the EU? 

I understand that you have to follow them to get the money but can’t figure out why"
Franz_Werfel,And who is contributing to rising food prices?
Conscious_Accident85,"If you make a bad decision with your finances around debt that’s not the governments fault.  Most farmers also did not buy the land they own. If they did they are doing very very well far more often than not.

Tractor’s and machinery is getting more expensive but the protests will not effect that in anyway and aren’t about that.

It’s not changing. In joining the EU in the first place the government a large part of it was government were willing to kill the fishing industry to help the farmers. Farmers benefit massively from the EU arguably more than anyone else. As you say yourself they are keeping there heads above water because of the EU and their funding."
WolfOfWexford,"I’m a farmer and I massively disagree with BISS. We know the majority of the price you pay for beef is going into the supermarkets pockets, not the farmers. Get rid of the subsidies and nationalise the meat factories with the idea of selling them off to cooperatives owned by farmers. 

We need the consumer product, sliced and packaged meat, to be produced by the farmers, not the middleman.

If you took the subsidies away from the dairy industry, the farmer would still turn a profit.

I’m from a tillage farm, we make 2k/ha net before subsidies. When we were selling to a grain merchant it was closer to 200/ha"

DiscussionUnusual466,"Ok let's do a little basic thoughts experiment 


Farmer A receives subsides to cover the cost of running the business and can lower his prices so milk only cost you 2 euro 


Farmer b doesn't receive the subsidies and has to factor in the cost so the milk cost you 4 euro 


Does that help you understand ?"
ConnolysMoustache,"Most of the regulations that we’re talking about are climate related, not safety related, imported food still needs to pass safety standards but its production doesn’t need to pass the same climate sustainability tests and regulations. 

If you get money from the EU for the sole purpose of implementing sustainable farming, you can’t just take the money and whinge that you have to uphold your side of the argument and implement sustainable farming. That’s what they’re whining about.

The EU is not a magic money tree. You have to uphold your side of the deal."
DiscussionUnusual466,"Increase in prices of fuel, fertilizer and grain , subsidies have not matched the increase so the cost has been passed on to us the consumers "
DiscussionUnusual466,Nationalise the meet factories is the same as subsidies just a different way of filling the hole in the accounts further up the line ...
TruthSeeker101110,"Sure if the farmer actually produces anything, which most don't.

In 2018 the average subsidy payments made up 74% of the a farms income of the average farm. For cattle and sheep farms, the payments were up to 158% of income. Anything over 100% means we are paying them more than what they are producing.

It reeks of just trying to hit arbitrary targets while actually increasing climate damage"

ConnolysMoustache,"Arbitrary targets? There’s nothing arbitrary about concrete targets for re wetting, re forrestation of our island, keeping emissions low and toxic run off out of our water ways

We can and should be better than those countries that take massive shits on their local environment.

No money is for nothing. If you’re a farmer and you don’t like these regulations, **don’t take the EU money** it’s that simple.

If you’re a farmer that’s taking EU money and you’re whining about regulations you need to shut up. No money is for nothing, the EU isn’t winning streak."
WolfOfWexford,Exactly. The best we could have is local small producers. Farm to fork
showars,"You’re absolutely right, we can and should be better than them. So why still import their produce? If we care so much about the planet surely we should be doing something there too? Sanctions, trade restrictions, “green” taxes etc

“If it’s not a problem here and it’s not our problem” doesn’t work with climate change."
ConnolysMoustache,"We’re never not going to import foreign produce, that’s how the modern economy works now so we have two options.


1 continue importing foreign produce because we have to and ensure that our locally produced produce isn’t literally poisoning our country, while giving farmers money to compensate them 

Or

2 continue importing foreign produce because we have to and not regulate our local produce, poisoning our local environment.

It’s a pretty easy answer in my opinion."
showars,"Why are they the two options? I’ve literally given you three options in the comment before. 

We absolutely can tax the fuck out of produce that is damaging it’s local ecosystems, and by extension our planet, while still giving our own farmers money to compensate them. We could reduce the cost of locally sourced foods using the tax on food imported from places that do not adhere to certain standards. 

We already do it for food safety so the fact that your only options are keep things as they are, which is subjectively not working, or do nothing is mad. The idea that we can only have extremes as you’ve suggested is ridiculous"
eire23,"Surprised there wasn't a thread on this with some of the details being out out yesterday. What are people thoughts on it. Sheep welfare scheme has been renewed which is good as its money for something that one would be doing anyways. Something for the suckler in it as well? See a new environmental scheme with a max payment of 10k what ever tthat will involve. Front loading on the first 30ha but it seems a small figure, something around 45 an entitlement. Thought it would've been more to suit some smaller farms. Was chatting the ag consultant this morning and she said that any land that's reseeded or getting a lot of manure will be impossible to get into these schemes or get a very low score. Click to expand... I'm looking at it from a critical point of view. Only 15% of farms will qualify for tier 2 of Glas and €10,000 so 85% of farms will only get a max of €7000 in Glas and with inflation, we won't be any better off than we were with Glas. Suckler farmers can already access grants of close to €200 per cow between BDGP and BEEPs. They are making it out that they are giving €300 more per cow. They're not. There's a lot of hoops to get the €200 that we already get and it looks like many, many more hoops to get the €300 proposed. Lads that weren't in BDGP or that didn't keep up their numbers, will face serious spend for to get there. Also, many lads don't think BDGP was a good idea ( I thought it was great!), so they will be hard to persuade to go into it. From talking to a planner doing plans for REAP, the multi species crop won't be a measure suited to any grassland that is being managed - any land that got sprayed with mcpa in the last 5 years won't make it. Any land reseeded in recent years won't make it. Any land getting a lot of fertilizer or slurry won't make it. I might farm wet land, but I try to grow as much grass as I can. I don't see it fair that they will reward my neighbor who puts nothing into grass management. But I'm sure that some of the lads who have recently sown multi species crops will gain from it. It's better than nothing, but if they expect it to make up for any future reduction in cow numbers, it won't. It might force more lads to get out altogether and plant their land or rent it to the dairy farmers."

The minister was visiting locally last week and got a hot reception i believe. One point a lot of ifa reps were making which I'd disagree with was that any increases and some of the decreases were being disguised in schemes with more work and paper etc. Rather than coming in the SFP. Broadly speaking I dont mind how many schemes there are, if it pays to fill out forms and carry out some environmental actions better than it does to finish stock im.ok with that to a certain level. A lot of lads still run down BEEP and BDGP and I know some who refuse to weigh stock and just make up the figures etc. To me thats nuts, those schemes are decent money for small input, more of those would be fine. That said there are other elements of the carbon reduction model that are needing a lot more work and would be happy to see more lobbying there"
candor,"With regard to convergence, to be honest it makes sense that it's a flat payment. Obviously that still depends on what land base you have to work with but at least the playing field is starting to level somewhat. Historical activities shouldn't come into it, as that is not neccessarily what is happening on the ground now. @muckymanor does make a good point about inflation though. The reduction in payments doesn't track with that. I'm new to farming in my own right and am treating the payment as a little business start up grant and am looking for ways to diversify farm income to keep my family on the land going into the future. Click to expand...

Seedsower,Ms awards are expensive to establish and have poor persistence Click to expand... No more expensive than other reseeds in terms of the work done to establish. The seed cost for the same seeding rate came in at roughly €10 per acre more expensive compared with a general grass mixture. The seed cost €97 per acre at 15kg. We are farming organically so no spray or fertiliser costs and it's growing away well. I'll come back to you in 10 years on the persistence. We'll be doing holistic planned grazing (similar to mob grazing in some respects) and I think the various species stand a better chance at persisting using that type of grazing management.

I have doubts that the chicory and plantain will survive those conditions and, so far anyway, over seeding has proved marginally beneficial wherever I've come across it.

For me, the big advantage should be lower fertilizer requirement. I can do the 30 day rotations. I wouldn't mind oversowing or stitching in seed every 4 or 5 years if the fertilizer savings being quoted are accurate. I know that it comes down to having proper pH and p and k indexes, but I'm confident that I have those in line for next year."

Will you have leafy regrowth regularly with no fertilizer? Click to expand... Basically what we done here was seek to reduce the bagged stuff and utilise fym and watery slurry at key times of year. This led over time to a greater variety of grass and herb species spreading threw the sward.The advantages of this was obviously low cost and allowed time for stock to get used to different sward mixes. I suspect it helped too that we have s0me SAC land which held a seed bank of these species so that obviously doesn't apply to everyone. However we did do some scarifying and over seeding with clover and timothy to speed things up on the outfarm which is generally drier ground and that worked well. We found the older native grass strains were also more robust when it came to late spring droughts or water logging after wet winters in terms of leafy re-growth when grazed"

Spreading soiled water is going to be more restricted and a separate holding tank might be needed. Fertiliser allowances dropped by 10% next year and another 5% in 2024. A 2 week reduction in permitted artificial fert spreading much the same as the slurry one above. There's a requirement to shallow cultivate tillage ground post harvest or sow a crop within 14 days. By 2025, only farms with stocking rates <100kgs will be permitted to use anything other than LESS for slurry. So if you're thinking of investing in LESS, soon would be best if you're thinking of going for a grant. Click to expand... I might have been able to get on board with extending the slurry ban for another week in January but cutting back October? These lads are f**king dopes."

The EU are making all the noises on the Green budget and what they are going to do to reduce emissions. It seems to me that whatever happens it will be introduced at European level and not at local level unless some specific exemption (such as the nitrates derogation). In that cases, our shower can do very little about it despite the current fiasco on forestry. On the greening payment, one could argue as tillage farmers obeying the 3 crop rule that we are already complicit in that? It has been opened up now that it will be harder not to qualify but the devil will be in the detail, the main one being eligible ground so for MSS is it grazing ground, for tillage measure is it tillage ground but what about stocking rate is it whole farm or grazing ground only."
