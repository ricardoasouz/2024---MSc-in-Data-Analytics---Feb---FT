This led over time to a greater variety of grass and herb species spreading threw the sward.The advantages of this was obviously low cost and allowed time for stock to get used to different sward mixes. I suspect it helped too that we have s0me SAC land which held a seed bank of these species so that obviously doesn't apply to everyone. However we did do some scarifying and over seeding with clover and timothy to speed things up on the outfarm   which is generally drier ground and that worked well. We found the older native grass strains were also more robust when it came to   late spring droughts or water logging after wet winters in terms of leafy re-growth when grazed"

The seed cost €97 per acre at 15kg.We are farming organically so no spray or fertiliser costs and it's growing away well.I'll come back to you in 10 years on the persistence. We'll be doing holistic planned grazing (similar to mob grazing in some respects) and I think the various species stand a better chance at persisting using that type of grazing management."

Was chatting the ag consultant this morning and she said that any land that's reseeded or getting a lot of manure will be impossible to get into these schemes or get a very low score.Click to expand...I'm looking at it from a critical point of view.Only 15% of farms will qualify for tier 2 of Glas and €10,000 so 85% of farms will only get a max of €7000 in Glas and with inflation, we won't be any better off than we were with Glas.Suckler farmers can already access grants of close to €200 per cow between BDGP and BEEPs. They are making it out that they are giving €300 more per cow. They're not. There's a lot of hoops to get the €200 that we already get and it looks like many, many more hoops to get the €300 proposed. Lads that weren't in BDGP or that didn't keep up their numbers, will face  serious spend for to get there. Also, many lads don't think BDGP was a good idea ( I thought it was great!), so they will be hard to persuade to go into it.From talking to a planner doing plans for REAP, the multi species crop won't be a measure suited to any grassland that is being managed - any land that got sprayed with mcpa in the last 5 years won't make it. Any land reseeded in recent years won't make it. Any land getting a lot of fertilizer or slurry won't make it. I might farm wet land, but I try to grow as much grass as I can. I don't see it fair that they will reward my neighbor who puts nothing into grass management. But I'm sure that some of the lads who have recently sown multi species crops will gain from it.It's better than nothing, but if they expect it to make up for any future reduction in cow numbers, it won't. It might force more lads to get out altogether and plant their land or rent it to the dairy farmers."

Broadly speaking I dont mind how many schemes there are, if it pays to fill out forms and carry out some environmental actions better than it does to finish stock im.ok with that to a certain level.  A lot of lads still run down BEEP and BDGP and I know some who refuse to weigh stock and just make up the figures etc. To me thats nuts,  those schemes are decent money for small input, more of those would be fine.That said there are other elements of the carbon reduction  model that are needing a lot more work and would be happy to see more lobbying there"
