    "Multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is one of the classical problems in reinforcement learning. A multi-armed bandit is actually a slot machine, a gambling game played in a casino where you pull the arm(lever) and get a payout(reward) based on some randomly generated probability distribution.  A single slot machine is called one-armed bandit and when there are multiple slot machines it is called as multi-armed bandits or k-armed bandits. Multi-armed bandits are shown below,"
