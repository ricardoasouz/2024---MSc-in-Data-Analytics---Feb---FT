    "## Introduction\n",
    "Whether you are referring to Twitter, Goodreads, or Amazon, there is scarcely any digital place that is not overrun with peoples' opinions. In the modern world, it is vital for businesses to delve into these perspectives and gain knowledge about their goods or services. However, the sheer volume of this data makes it virtually hard to measure it manually. Sentiment Analysis, yet another benefit of data science, enters the picture at this point. In this post, we'll examine what sentiment analysis entails and the many Python implementations that are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Sentiment Analysis?\n",
    "Sentiment analysis falls under the heading of text classification and is a use case of natural language processing (NLP). Simply described, sentiment analysis includes categorizing a text into several emotions, such as happy or sad, neutral, or happy or sad. Determining the underlying tone, emotion, or sentiment of a document is the ultimate goal of sentiment analysis. Another name for this is opinion mining.\n",
    "\n",
    "## VADER\n",
    "VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is a rule-based sentiment analyzer that has been trained on social media text. Just like Text Blob, its usage in Python is pretty simple."
